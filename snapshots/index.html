                    <p>Snapshots is a photo management system created in response to the growing pains that are faced by amateur and professional photographers, who lack access to an appropriate means for meticulous organization.</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>Snapshots was a one-week long project for a UX/UI strategy course. <span class="highlight">The brief tested our individual ability to process and develop a solution by synthesizing user data, behaviors, and pain points that were provided to us</span>. This response was to be contextualized in a high-fidelity prototype that exemplified our solution.</p>

                        <h2>Parsing data</h2>
                        <h3>Meeting the muses</h3>
                        <p>To begin addressing the issue, the first step was to parse through the data points that were
                            issued from a user interview with photographers, Marlene and Jackson. The screencap below
                            illustrates a small sample of the dataset, which reflects these individual's experiences
                            related to photography. Together, <span class="highlight">Marlene and Jackson represent the two extremes of the photography spectrum respectively, one as a professional and the other an amateur</span>.</p>

                        <p>To better format and address these responses, while also grouping each individual's
                            experiences by their uniqueness and shared commonalities, <span class="highlight">I categorized their attributes using a venn diagram.

                        <h4>Marlene</h4>
                        <p>Between the two interviewed users, Marlene's skillsets weigh towards the professional side of
                            photography. Her kit encompasses a collection of lenses that she uses for different purposes.
                            Her photoshoot preference is to compose and capture photos for their qualitative
                            aspect, rather than quantative. <span class="highlight">We learn that her frustrations are mainly with the
                            post-production process of sorting and organizing her work, as lengthy photoshoots can yield
                            over hundreds of photos</span>. Thus, she would also appreciate the flexibility and customization for
                            thematic categorization.</p>

                        <h4>Jackson</h4>
                        <p>On the other hand, Jackson is a happy-go-lucky kind of photographer â€“ capturing anything and
                            everything that brings him joy, so he can immortalize it in his photographic collection.
                            As a result of this behavior, <span class="highlight">he finds himself needing the ability to organize and archive
                            his photos, but can still retrieve it whenever.</span> Lastly, as Jackson finds that he photographs the most when he is on his travels, he would benefit from a cloud-based and multi-platform app.

                        <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
                        <h3>Framing the problem</h3>
                        <p><span class="highlight">Both Marlene and Jackson desire a photo management system that allows them high control and autonomy in managing photo categorization and metadata, but lack the tools to do so in a readily accessible manner</span>.</p>

                    <div class="writeup-container">
                        <h3>Opportunities in view</h3>
                        <p>Between Marlene and Jackson, <span class="highlight">there were several shared solutions that could be implemented to bridge their needs</span>. Below were my takeaways for what design decisions I could make to tailor to make a viable product.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Access and view metadata</strong> with the ability to categorize by and edit details of themes, size, color, people, and more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emphasize a facet system </strong> when searching for photos to utilize the default or customized metadata associated with them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Showcase previous work</strong> so that they're not forgotten once they've been uploaded.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="writeup-container">
                        <h3>Snaps of inspiration</h3>
                        <p>Due to this project's slim timeline, the brief only required a high-fidelity prototype in the
                            end. However, to get a better sense of what the current states and standards are for photo
                            management apps, I personally looked to Apple's desktop iOS photo app for inspiration, in
                            addition to trends that were prevalent on sites like Dribbble and Pinterest.</p>
                            
                        <p><span class="highlight">I focused on finding design inspirations that were more function-based over form</span>, as this would not have been a realistic project to be tinkering with overly flashy or excessive visuals due to the tight deadline. Moreover, although I was creating a photo app, <span class="highlight">I also looked at dashboard designs, as I feel they provide overview to data in a readily-sighted method, which is what Marlene and Jackson hope to have</span>.</p>

                        <p>Below are a series of four screens that create Snapshots. <span class="highlight">The idea
                            of this management software is to provide photo enthusiasts the flexibility of customizing
                            their visual works through a number of cataloguing techniques, ranging from smart uploads
                            that flag duplicates and out-of-focus compositions, to facet-browsing, and tagging systems</span>.
                            Snapshots aims to support the organizational and archival needs of photography creatives.</p>

                            <li>While neither Marlene or Jackson mentioned legibility and scalability as an issue, users can scale in and out of the page. This implementation was important for accessibility, especially if Snapshots may potentially cater to an older demographic based on the two existing prospective users. There are also toggles for gallery and list view. For someone like Marlene, this integrates for support for bulk editing medatadata.</li>
                            <li>This sidebar includes options for photo-cataloguing and an upload button. These are accessible from every page to ensure efficient navigation.</li>

                            <li>As both Marlene and Jackson had tendencies to share photos with those in their circle, I also included a "From your friends" section to help them foster that socialization.</li>

                            <li>Users can also access an editor to make basic modifications like color grading. Jackson noted that he often rotates his photos, but has to use a separate app as his photo management app lacks this functionality. In contrast, Marlene prefers to keep her photos unedited. The feature was added as the usability and benefit far outweigh not including one, but it is not made central to the experience so as not to dilute the photo management focus with a photo editor.</li>
                            <li>Selected photos will display the metadata and detail that belong to it. Users can also rate their photo, add tags, and change the colors associated. These optional and automatic features can help users refine their search in the future.</li>

                    <p>With a one-week deadline, there were limitations put in place for how large of a scope this
                        project could cover. <span class="highlight">As such, if you've played with the prototype, you'll notice that there were features mentioned and shown, but were not actually implemented and fleshed out</span>. For example, the true social functionalities behind the "From your friends" category on the homepage, the photo editor's interface and features,
                        or the outcome and actual logic behind smart uploads.</p>

                    <p>Although it is easy to dream of all the perfect features, thoughtful prototyping does require time.
                        Either way, <span class="highlight">the exercise was a test to our response and how we justify and design user-centric, which in this case, I feel that I've done a successful job implementing a happy medium between Marlene and Jackson</span>.</p>

                        <p>Design is never finished, and this is no exception. There are still quite a lot of areas to explore for Snapshots, so here are some of my thoughts:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Finding opportunities for photographers inbetween</strong> the skills of Marlene and Jackson. I tried consciously to design outward beyond the two established users, but I'd be curious to explore what other photographer styles exist between them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implementing the told-but-not-shown</strong> features that were not prototyped to create a more conclusive experience in Snapshots.</li>
                            <li><strong>Designing a mobile-version</strong> as a cloud-based and portable app, which was a wishlist item of Jackson's, but was out of scope for the project brief.</li>
                        </ol>
