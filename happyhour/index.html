                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>With doomscrolling, the endless scrolling through bad news, manifesting as a habit of social media, Happy Hour is a news publication platform that offers an optimistic media alternative to the doom-and-gloom style of news perpetuated in mainstream media.</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <h3>Creating a new outlook</h3>
                    <p>Was it just me, or was there a period of time where the highly polarizing politics of our neighbours down south paired with the ongoing pandemic filled our social spaces with a bleak outlook? Oh, it was everyone? <em>Great.</em> Well, we really needed a fix, so... to the salon!</p>
                        
                    <p>For this project, <span class="highlight">I wanted to create a news publication platform that focused on uplifting, positive news</span>. As Black Panther would say, engage your defences. Alas, here I am putting mine up against the bad jujus!</p>

                    <p>So, let me tell you how Happy Hour came from a UX/UI design course that asked for a response to an issue of our choosing. Although completed individually, I was supported by tremendous individuals during the research and testing stages.</p>

                        <h2>Product Validation</h2>
                        <h3>The search for user data</h3>
                        <p>To ensure people wanted a break from the bad juju, <span class="highlight">I conducted one-on-one interviews with five individuals and surveyed 42 participants between the ages of 21 and 35 to learn about their behaviors and usages towards social and news media</span>.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Most respondents had an easier time engaging with social media for 2 to 3 hours per day, compared to reading the news, which most limit to an hour.</li>
                            <li>Social media did not often influence a respondent emotionally or mentally, but in circumstances where it did, it left positive feelings.</li>
                            <li>2% of respondents claimed the news positively affects them, 43% felt neutral, while the remaining 52% felt negatively.</li>
                            <li>From social media, respondents enjoyed socializing and shareability. These features are sometimes missing in media apps, making it less enjoyable for them.</li>
                            <li>News content lacking in quality and factuality would be faced with apprehension.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>One point of interest to note was that <span class="highlight">respondents concerned themselves with the credibility of news pieces, if the context was staying informed</span>. If they were browsing with a leisurely mindset? Not so much. The interviews and surveys also gave an understanding to what respondents felt were currently missing from news media. <span class="highlight">These findings helped me pivot my concept to integrate a credibility-focused and socially-driven ethos into the app.</span></p>

                        <p>Before committing to any fidelity of prototyping, I needed to work out each of the core component's interactive logic. <span class="highlight">For brevity, I'll be covering the process and evolution of the Bookmarking function, starting with the userflow below.</span> If you're interested in the other core component processes, you can view the comprehensive submission linked at the top and bottom of this page!</p>
                        
                        <p>Here, I considered the complexities required of the Bookmarking function. What constitutes a complete bookmark action? What tools and controls do users have? What methods do they have for retrieval?</p>

                        <p>I was able to conceptualize the user flow and journey map into a series of five mid-fi (mid-fidelity) screens for Bookmarking. <span class="highlight">For efficiency, bookmarking can be initiated when an article appears without actually requiring the user to click into it, minimizing their need to be fully invested in order to keep it tabs on it</span>.</p>

                        <p>When a user clicks on the bookmark icon, a pop-up appears for users to save the article. Clicking on the dropdown next to 'Save Article' will swap the layout for existing folders, while clicking the '+' will trigger the ability to create a new folder.</p>

                        <h3>Conducting usability testing rounds</h3>
                        <p>To test this user flow, <span class="highlight">I recruited six potential Happy Hour users for a usability test, measuring their interaction with benchmarks that utilized time-spent and number of clicks to determine their success.</span> Their goal was to find an article of their choosing and bookmark it to folder titled 'Emotional'. With the data I collected, I would compare it against the minimum amount of time and actions needed to complete the task. In-depth testing metrics can be found in the comprehensive submission linked at the top and end of this page.
                            
                        <p><span class="highlight">While my users were successful in their endeavors, some participants expected a different interaction response</span>. A few had the idea that simply clicking the icon would complete the interaction of bookmarking. On the other hand, others had found the display of previous articles in the pop-up distracting and confusing.</p>
                            
                        <p><span class="highlight">How could I fix these mismatched expectation to meet with users who <em>do</em> value a the organization and customization of the existing interaction?</span> To remedy this, I improved the logic of the bookmarking flow, photographed below.

To contrast, a long-press would trigger the 'Select folder' rather than 'Save article'. All in all, the second screen was ultimately replaced to create consistency in the overall logic of the bookmarking process.
                        </p>

                        <p><span class="highlight">However, with long-press interactions not being supported on Figma, the long-press process was selected as the default due to it being the dominant request and it also encompassing more user choice.</span><p>

                        <p>Speaking on the project as a whole, simply bringing the concept to life with the integrated core components was a massive undertaking. This project allowed me to sink my teeth in and take control of all creative aspects that some designers may only touch base on here and there. <span class="highlight">To have built Happy Hour from the ground up by myself, it formed quite a meticulous and holistic view for the entire process of integrating user experience at every stage of interface design. For that, this project gave me tremendous growth as a designer</span>. But, that doesn't mean the design work is complete or that the execution was to a finesse.</p>

                        <h3>A hopeful to-do list</h3>
                        <p>It truly was a huge undertaking to do this individually. Sometimes, I wish we were given more time or push to be experimental in our approach, rather than creating something that is tried and true. Below are some key considerations I'd hope for the future of Happy Hour.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Integrating an actual Happy Hour</strong>, because it's a bit ironic that for an app called Happy Hour, there's no feature that limits a user's consumption time. Setting up a limit like this could help users stay connected, but still prevent them from overconsuming.</li>
                            <li><strong>An option for content length</strong>, as it was one thing that was brought up in the user interviews. While the current iteration displays time estimates for an article's reading time, it would be nice to take this a step further. The homepage currently features a Curated and Trending section, so perhaps it could be expanded to include options for Quick Reads and Long Reads.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conducting an in-depth competitor analysis</strong> to understand how Happy Hour can further distinguish themselves beyond just content. What other design elements can be integrated to support and improve credibility and socialization, or even concerns that have not been previously brought up?</li>
                        </ol>
