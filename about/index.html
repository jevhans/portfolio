                                <p>I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ArchitecturalDigest" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Architectural Digest</a> videos and Vogue's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztAHXmlMZFQqnEL2hPOHFDyROa3h--xl" class="intext-link" target="_blank">72 questions</a>, so let's roleplay. You're the camera person in bold and I'm the celebrity.</p>

                                <p class="script">Begin scene.</p>

                                <p class="bold nospace">Thanks for having me! Do you prefer Jeff or Jeffrey?</p>
                                <p class="nospace-top">Of course! You're always welcome to my internet nook, and whichever rolls off the tongue better for you!</p>

                                <p class="bold nospace">Alright Jeff, can you tell me a little about yourself?</p>
                                <p class="nospace-top">I'm a User Experience and Interface Designer based in Vancouver, Canada! My creative philosophy is to design with conviction, thoughtfulness, and a dash of fun. The last is the most important ingredient of all, as I am a strong believer that it helps foster an ongoing embodiment of creativity and curiosity. For me, if I'm not having fun and exploring in my work, I'm not doing my best as a designer!</p>

                                <p class="bold nospace">That is a great philosophy! What are some things that make you happy?</p>
                                <p class="nospace-top">Rom-Coms and Hallmark Christmas movies, going to open houses and seeing home renos, low-stake pranks, leashed cats that explore the outdoors, peanut butter, taking pictures of almost everything, and <em>excessively</em> long walks.</p>

                                <p class="bold nospace">I love that list. And is there anything that makes you mad?</p>
                                <p class="nospace-top">Oh, yes. Hollywood not releasing Rom-Com movies like they did in the mid-to-late 2000's, doors that say pull but don't open when you pull, so you try to push, and then realize it was a pull door all along, and cereal dust.</p>

                                <p>Anyway, that's all for now â€“ please enjoy your stay and be sure to look around!</p>

                                    <p>My primary focus was bridging the company branding with the user experience and interface designs of our digital products. At times, I lead and coordinated different teams across departments to overhaul the usability and aesthetics of client-facing portals for multiple products. Other noteworthy projects included co-champion a marketing campaign from conception to launch, where I modelled the 3D product, created an Instagram filter, prototyped and implemented the landing page, using tools such as Maya, SparksAR, Figma, and Wordpress. Additional works included motion design, where I supported social media campaigns with custom-made GIFs, infographics and educational videos.</p>

My responsibilities included creating weekly visuals to supoort marketing channels such as eCommerce, email, social media, and physical advertisements for upcoming marketing initiatives and store operation. I supported with designing labels and packaging for upcoming merchandise, in addition to spatial mockups for potential storefront and interior signage. As the videographer, I filmed and edited videos for education-based campaigns, while collaborating with the marketing team to direct. Furthermore, I developed and revamped web pages to enhance information architecture, customer experience, and page functionality.</p>

With the deliverable of creating enamel pins that would be distributed out to the volunteers, the project sought to create graphics that represented the several faculties that supported the event. Approximately 1,000 pins were distributed and the final collection of enamel pins offered a variety of five different illustrations, each showcasing a thematic visual to the faculties present. </p>
