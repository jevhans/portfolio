                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <h3>What lies beyond the sky</h3>
                    <p>If you've seen my project <a href="../typology/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">TYPOLOGY</a>, this was the assignment that followed. <span class="highlight">The objective was to create an educational website while showcasing the use of animations or interactions. I chose to experiment with a photography-heavy approach, as Typology was primarily typographic elements</span>. I selected space exploration to spotlight celestial bodies and space technology, showcasing the amazing discoveries from humankind. My goal was to mix photography and content seamlessly to foster a memorable learning experience of self-driven exploration.<p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to this project's need for written content, it was suggested we borrow from open domain. Although I would've redesigned NASA's <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" class="intext-link">Solar System Exploration page</a> directly, the syllabus wanted to avoid copyright issues even though federal government and agency work cannot be copyrighted under United States copyright laws. Nonetheless, the content used in the designs have been cautiously paraphrased, and despite the project being titled Aerospace, these interfaces have been created with NASA and their audiences in mind. </p>

                        <h3>Have you seen this big space rock?</h3>
                        <p>NASA's Solar System Exploration is filled with incredible pockets of information. One of their interactive features include an explorable map where you can scale in and out to see a planet's orbit and relationship to one another within space. The bottom of these exploration pages often come equipped with a section for 'More Destinations', linking you to other celestial bodies. <span class="highlight">Although there were plenty of learning aids, I thought they were missing a sense of grandness and scale</span>. Even the mouse-feel of the explorable map didn't reflect the expansiveness of the universe of even the sizes of the celestial bodies themselves.</p>

                        <h3>Going the distance</h3>
                        <p>Since this project required some interactions, I saw a chance to combine the two features NASA has. Science fact: to conduct any form of exploration, there's got to be movement, but don't quote me on the technicalities, I'm only a designerologist. Anyway, <span class="highlight">to visualize exploration, I could map an animated transition between the planets for when people browse around, replicating the effect of distance travelled between the destinations</span> as they would do in actual space!

                        <p><span class="highlight">While I also had the idea to represent the distance it takes to travel between the planets through transition duration, I came to the unfortunate conclusion that it would've made for a horrid user experience</span>. Representing Astronomical Units using time, it would take 0.4 milliseconds going from the Sun to Mercury, and a whopping 37 seconds from the Sun to Pluto. It was also here that I learned Adobe XD's canvas space is not infinite like the universe, so really, my animated planets barely made it in with the current spacing they have.</p>
                        
                        <p>Regardless of this, part of the grandeur of space travel still exists in the presented interaction by allowing users to be in control of their travel, and therefore, ability to visualize the celestial bodies that exist inbetween these space giants. I believe NASA gives out a badge for conducting space explorations, no? Food for thought...</p>

                        <p>Although I've showed many of the existing pages above for Aerospace, I thought it would be nice to include a picture of all the interfaces created. Looking back, <span class="highlight">it was a liberating exercise to design with form taking a bigger seat over function, rather than the usual meticulous balance between the two</span>. Executing my idea took a detailed process to ensure that I was able to find pictures that properly depicted the environment of these planets and topics at hand.</p>
                        
                        <p>As it turns out, we don't have many environmental and atmospheric pictures of planets except for Mars and the Moon. <span class="highlight">Had I tried to work this idea with the other individual planets, it would be met with difficulty due to limited photographic options</span>. This concept is a fun day for visual design, but not so much for experience design and development. But hey, if this was an actual NASA project, who's to say there isn't a whole team for support... and maybe even digital artists that do mean renderings!</p>
