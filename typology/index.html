                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>TYPOLOGY provides designers an intimate knowledge of the fundamentals of typographic identity through an app. It details a typeface's history and its creators, its modern usage, and offers a deep-dive into its form and function. Designers can access a wealth of typographic studies, helping them strengthen their resolve with typography and its applications.</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <h3>The faces of friends</h3>
                    <p>I consider myself to be pretty good at recognizing people's faces, but when it comes to fonts, not so much. As a designer, this is a national tragedy, but it's something I've tried to work on. You see, I've found myself on many occasions searching the web for a tool that would help me become better at identifying and recognizing fonts. After all, they're just as important as the faces of my friends!</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, aside from Stephen Coles' <a href="https://typeanatomy.com/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Anatomy of Type</a>, and <a href="https://typographica.org/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Typographica.org</a> - both of which offer knowledge and commentary to a limited degree, what I was looking for simply didn't exist. With this, <span class="highlight">I wanted to create an all-in-one pocket guide that offers an active role in learning typography and fonts, teaching even at an atomic level by delving into a individual glyphs and typographic characteristics</span> like x-height, ascenders, of a font family and more!</p>

                    <p>When an interface design course I was taking asked us to design an app that provided a product or service with the intent of educating a group of users, I thought it would be a fantastic opportunity to bring this to life. <span class="highlight">Formally, the deliverable only required a finished high-fidelity product, but I did carry out some user experience formalities before designing</span>.</p>

                    <p>As the project was going straight into high-fidelity prototyping, I opted to create a user flow to better visualize the different pathways and actions a user could take with each task I had set out to do. <span class="highlight">This was particularly helpful when developing screens and components for my tasks, as I able to plan for the actions that took place at each stage.</span></p>

                        <p>When it came to figuring out an identity system for TYPOLOGY, I wanted to incorporate a thematic approach to what it was representing. As I've mentioned earlier, <span class="highlight">since type lends a given space with its own quirks, I thought it would be fitting to have the them mould the context. I selected a neutral canvas to let the fonts and weights drive the identity</span>. The color palette consists of various shades of grey, as well as a royal blue to make odes to traditional pen, ink, and paper.</p>

                        <p>I really enjoyed bringing TYPOLOGY to life, and would love to expand on the idea one day when I can integrate more features and thoroughly step through a proper development process with it. Even though these attributes were mostly absent, when I presented this product, <span class="highlight">several designers mentioned that they would find tremendous value with an app like TYPOLOGY, and I will take that as a win</span>!</p>

                        <p>Although this project was only two weeks long, it did feel like a quick and brief exercise. To fully realize this potential, there are definitely some next steps to be taken to elevate the experience:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Conduct user testing</strong> to get further insights on how prospective designers are finding the interface, the layout, the experience, and what they think could be added on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complete the Challenge experience</strong> as I only prototyped the Quiz component and not Memorize. Getting user feedback would help build the Memorize task, so it can be created with concrete user behavior and data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adding more details and sections to the Deep Dive</strong> to fully support its role as an educational archive. Designing apps with no pre-existing content is especially hard when it's a three-way juggle between usability, design, and content writing. As this was a design course, my focus wasn't content writing, but each type page deserves to have its potential realized.</li>
