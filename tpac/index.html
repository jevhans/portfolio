                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In 2008, an international competition was launched with the objective of finding a design for the upcoming Performing Arts Center in Taipei. The venue required three theatre spaces to support operas and various art performances. <a class="intext-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nlarchitects.nl/">NL Architects</a>, a Dutch-based architectural firm submitted a proposal that explored the ideas of a physical structure inspired by a tabletop.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="highlight">The four 'legs' of the building would create a central void, allowing the an 'exterior' public space to be integrated into its core</span>. The competition winners were crowned to another Dutch-based firm, <a class="intext-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.oma.com/projects/taipei-performing-arts-center">OMA</a>, and the performing arts center has now been built to their design.</p>

                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>As part of a Spatial Design course, I worked alongside a group of four to explore NL Architects' submission for the Taipei Performing Arts Center. Our timeline of six weeks were split between research, prototyping, and digital rendering. <span class="highlight">My role was primarily dedicated to the first physical prototype, the exterior of the second prototype, and most of the 3D modelling and rendering of the buildings</span>.</p>

                    <h3>NL Architects</h3>
                    <p>Below are a series of renderings submitted by NL Architects. The form of the structure was heavily influenced by their consideration of spaces that are public and private, as well as finding an intersection that blends the two concepts together. <span class="highlight">The unique distribution of space on elevated floors also lend to the contrast of public and private, putting the building's inhabitants and visitors at the forefront</span>.</p>

However, we were able to map the four exterior faces while interpolating the dimensions of the floor plans, which allowed us to create our take on the structure from what we could piece together.</p>

                    <p><span class="highlight">Our renderings were supported by NL Architects' invisioned floor plan. The lack of exact measurements resulted in our dimensions to be based off of aligning the four main views and the floor plan</span>. Using these references, we created our own guess of exact measurements that we felt were sensible when translating into units for our model. As these compile overtime, it created in construction faults and mismatch in propositions. This is particularly noticeable when comparing the floor heights and the size of the interior escalators, as well as the unfilled interior volume. In NL Architects' rendering, their interior void is much more compact in comparison to ours.</p>

                    <p>Looking back on the project, there was also something that we missed accounting for. With the way the models were created, we didn't consider the thickness of walls. This is noticeable to the rendered interior South view's bottom right, where the walls meet the floor. Strangely, this visually appears the same in NL Architects' rendering, but it might simply be a rendering issue of a lack of shadows creating a visible thickness.</p>

                    <p>The following images represent the low-fidelity model that was completed alongside the digital renderings. <span class="highlight">The challenge restricted construction material to paper, glue, and tape</span>, but we refrained from using tape as it felt like it would detract from the cleanliness when binding edges.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our paper choice was dictated by our need for rigidity in structural support. For this, we chose a thicker blotting paper. We appreciated the matteness as the glossiness from standard cardstock felt too shiny. The downside to this material was the force required to make clean cut lines due to its density. For binding, we used a combination of superglue for visible edges, and for interior portions that were hidden, we resorted to hot glue for its fast drying abilities.</p>

                    <h3>High-fidelity</h3>
                    <p>After having experienced the physical making of the first model, we were tasked again to create the same one but with a high-fidelity finish. We set out to bring additional elements that we were unable to do with the low-fidelity model. In the performance building brief, the stakeholders requested for architects to implement theatre venues, which NL Architects answered in their submission. <span class="highlight">We wanted our next model to focus on showcasing the interior aspects of this building, and thus decided to create a pull-out that would model the theatre spaces alotted within</span>.</p>

                    <p>Taking lessons from our first model, we selected cardstock paper for our material. As the interior was the main focus, the matteness of blotting paper would create too much resistance when trying to move the pull-out component. <span class="highlight">This time, cardstock supported our vision better as its glossiness and smoother finish would minimize drag</span>. This allowed us to create an outer-casing, which would be built using one large piece of cardstock, moulded by scores. By creating a cast to encapsulate the interior, it provided for more wiggle room when interacting with the model.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <h3>The good and the bad</h3>
                    <p><span class="highlight">The six weeks that were dedicated to this project were absolute hell, and yet when I look back on it, I have nothing but fond memories</span>. From the consecutive all-nighters, the stress crying over construction, and the numbness our fingers endured when cutting with x-acto on dense paper, it all fostered comraderie and a project feels different when there's a collectively shared agreement to uphold an ethos of polish, care, and detailedness. Plus, if I'm going to be honest, this class is a rite of passage. Our shared outlook most likely came from the fear of failure and embarrassment. We did not want to see our models get binned or our printouts get shredded, because it's has happened in the history of this course! <span class="highlight">That fear we experienced truly imprinted the lesson of meticulousness and craftsmanship, even if we didn't always get it right</span>.</p>

                    <p>Beyond this six-week project, the full 14-weeks of the course also taught me how thoughtful design can impact environment, especially if you can physically experience it. Spatial design should take context and atmospheric cues from its community and immediate environment. A well-designed building means that you cannot take it and plop it somewhere else. It would lose its significance. A building should have a sense of recurring motifs that flow through the very core of the building, a unifying element that tells a story about its character. It should also give consideration to someone's experience upon arrival or departure within a space. I mean how cool is that? Have you ever consciously thought about how walking into a building made you feel? If there's one experience that makes me pursue Architecture in the future, well, it came from this!</p>
